# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.0 (September 19, 2020)

### New features

- Domains - allow creating a domain under a certain context to split the chain into a standalone context root (parent chain will not depend on its completion for release).
- Configurations settings.

### Improvements

- Favoring direct assign over spread calls.
- Monitor now is controlled by config, will not enrich execution context nodes by default.
